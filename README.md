Due to that Github has file limit of 50 MB. The files of 2015-2020 responses are not uploaded to the folder Summary_Data. Please download these data from Stack Overflow and put them in the folder.  

## Project Motivation
This project is motived by the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. As the first project work, I am requested to analyze dataset using the knowledge learned. I found it interesting to get to know what is like being a female programmer. Can the data tell us some insights that we still do not know. 

## File Descriptions
This project contains the following files:
- StackoverflowData.ipynb:  A jupyter notebook that contains all codes required. 
- Original_data: Data downloaded from the Stack Overflow. They are zip files and can be downloaded [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
- Summary_Data: unziped data files in csv format. 
- Pics_MediumArticle: The pictures that are used in the medium article. 

## Results
The main results of the project is publish in Medium. The link to the article can be found [here](https://medium.com/@hellogaga/what-survey-data-tells-about-being-a-female-developer-9a6b81db1e8e?source=friends_link&sk=4b6477533cdd7e0e22f1921dc6876e2a).
